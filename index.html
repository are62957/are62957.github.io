<p>The band has had many lineups throughout the years, specifically when they were just starting off. 
As a young band they were still trying to find the best pieces to fit there style of music. 
They had gone through a few drummers and guitarists, at first trying to fin there rhythm.
The settle for a new style of guitar playing called "dueling" in which the had multiple guitar leads, each complementing one another while at the same time playing different notes.
This blend lead to a new technique of songwriting, as well as opened the door for experimentation. 
As they started to find themselves musically, they finally hit it big with their first full studio album,<i> Iron Maiden</i>.
With Paul Di'Anno as the lead vocalist they would start to gain recognition.
It wasn't until the bands third album,<i> The Number of the Beast</i>, in which they would strike it bi; 
Replacing lead vocalist Di'Anno with Bruce Dickinson, they would soon be shot to international fame.

<p>Iron maiden has gone on to sell over <b> 100 million albums worldwide</b>, making them one of the most successful heavy metal bands of all time, as well as one of the most successful bands of all time.
They have been able to achieve this with little to no radio airtime in the United States, as when they released the music in the 80's they were considered to "evil" due to the lyrics and references used.
Although, wrongly labeled as "outcasts" and "dark" they were still able to achieve commercial success as they lyrics and genres provided an escape for many during the time. 
Of there albums, 12 have reached top 5 of the charts when released, with 2 more reaching the top 10, and 2 more reaching the top 15.
In addition, all but two(when lead singer Bruce Dickinson left band for 3 years) have reached gold and platinum status.
